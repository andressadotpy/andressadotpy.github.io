### hello  
My name is Andressa Cabistani, I'm a 23 years old Brazilian woman. I'm
a mom, wife and a self-taught Back End Developer. I find myself passionate
about programming and self-learning. I believe sharing knowledge is a powerful tool
to learn, that's why I created this blog. I love Open Source and that's my
way to start contributing more to the developer community. Also, although my
native language is Portuguese, I'll be posting more in English, but feel free to contact me in Portuguese if you want!  

Currently I teach kids how to program while teaching English. I love to teach and talk.
Sometimes, I'll be posting some stuff about it.


### my history

I used to study Aerospace Engineering until I found myself a programmer. I always knew
my place was somewhere inside technology, but it wasn't there, as though my
time there was very important to get to know what I didn't want to do. Now, I'm in
my path to become an autodidact computer scientist and I'm still
at the beginning of my journey, and will be posting about some stuff I learn in here.
