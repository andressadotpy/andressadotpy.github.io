Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Quality Engineer who spends her days diving deep into code and making sure software works as beautifully as intended. Currently, I'm part of the amazing team at Red Hat, where open-source isn't just a buzzwordâ€”it's our way of life.

My programming journey is like a well-stocked toolkit: Python, Ruby, and Go are my daily companions, with JavaScript adding extra flavor to the mix (thanks to my Computer Science degree from the University of London!). Some days, I find myself switching between four different programming languages, and you know what? Those are the days I love most. There's something magical about speaking multiple programming languages in a single dayâ€”it keeps the mind sharp and the creativity flowing.

But here's what really gets me excited: beyond the lines of code, I'm all about building bridges. Whether it's sharing knowledge with fellow developers, brainstorming innovative solutions, or helping teams level up their game, I believe in the power of collaboration. Over the past five years, I've learned that quality code is just the beginningâ€”it's the people and the shared journey that make technology truly transformative.

When I'm not crafting test automation or debugging code, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing my adventures right here on this blog. Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where we'll talk tech, share experiences, and maybe even crack a few programming jokes along the way! 

Let's build something amazing together. ðŸš€
