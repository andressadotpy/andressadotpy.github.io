Nothing better as a first post here than talking about how I study. First of all,
I don't have any problems with Universities, but I really prefer self-learning.
This post is for everyone! People who study in some University and want different
learning sources and others that are planning studies about Computer Science
on their own.  

Although I'm a Brazilian woman and my natural language is Portuguese, English is a
powerful tool when you decide to plan your own studies because there is such a huge
amount of materials available in it. If you know English, use it and improve it!

### CS topics

Here I'll be talking about Computer Science topics and not about how I planned
my studies about a programming language. Now that I mentioned it, I'll be talking
about my Python studies in other posts, this is a more not-language-specific post
(although some lectures use Python as teaching tool).

So, few weeks ago my beloved husband and I created a GitHub repository with
our study planning of Computer Science. Our goal was to plan the equivalent of an
entire Computer Science undergraduate program based on the
[Computer Science and Engineering 2019 MIT Curriculum](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/docs/ug/freshman_roadmaps.pdf),
with only freely available courses and almost
every lecture from top notch Universities such as MIT, Stanford and UC Berkeley.  

The courses are all in English with English subtitles and if English isn't your
natural language and you are reading this post, it means you know a little bit and
are interested in Computer Science. I learned English mainly from watching TV Series/Movies
with all English audio and subtitles and it's great to improve it with something
that I love studying about.

We divided the courses (only because we wanted to) in:
- Introductory
- Intermediate
- Advanced
- Extras (that are not included in the base MIT CS curriculum, but we will
be watching anyway)


Most courses are available at [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm),
[Lagunita](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
